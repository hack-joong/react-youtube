I also may or may not still live with my mom so I feel guilty gaming while at home. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under the stairs in a hidden closet so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom didn’t find out about this project, I sent her and my sister to Paris for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But Little Girl Finds A Secret Room In Her House That Leads Into An Even Wilder Surprise, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

I also may or may not still live with my mom so I feel guilty gaming while at home. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under the stairs in a hidden closet so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom didn’t find out about this project, I sent her and my sister to Paris for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But Little Girl Finds A Secret Room In Her House That Leads Into An Even Wilder Surprise, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) builds a secret hidden gaming room inside the stairs to hide from his mom!"

              "description": "Nicholaus Joseph Williams, better known by his stage name Trinidad James is a Trinidadian-American rapper. In 2012, he signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The label dropped him in 2014 when he failed to release an album, although he continues to release music as an independent artist and is signed to Artist Publishing Group for songwriting.  \n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking who does Trinidad want to be? The interview starts very awkwardly as Trinidad has a bear mask on. Trinidad challenges Marco and says Marco brought him on the show to exploit him. The tables are turned as Trinidad seems to be trolling Marco and has him on his toes. Marco asks Trinidad to remove his mask and Trinidad asks Marco to tie his tie and in exchange Trinidad takes the tie and puts it on. Trinidad takes off his mask to reveal his face with one eyed made up. Marco gets into the interview asking why Trinidad hasn’t made any new music. Trinidad reveals that he wanted to know what the business of entertainment was about. Trinidad talks about his relationships with record labels. Trinidad goes deeper into relationships. Trinidad then goes into his various products and the meaning behind them. Trinidad asks Marco what he thinks about him. Trinidad and Marco go back and forth about the word ugly. The conversation speeds up and the two go back and forth. Marco’s phone goes off and Marco blames it on Matt the Producer. Matt the Producer enters and Trinidad and Matt get into a discussion that gets a little tense. Trinidad and Marco continue the interview. Marco asks Trinidad about his hair. Matt the Producer tells Trinidad to get out of Marco’s creative space. A lady enters from the backstage and Trinidad yells at the lady and Marco invites her on stage. She awkwardly exits and Marco attempts to end the interview as Marco exits while talking to Matt the Producer and the mics are hot. Trinidad throws his chair and goes under the ladder and Matt the Producer holds exception.\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com",
